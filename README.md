# IVC-symbolic-visualizer (Streamlit)

A small Streamlit-based visualization for neutralized sample vector fields inspired by Ojibwe water-symbol geometry.
This is an initial research/visual prototype intended for educational and collaborative use.

## Quick start (local)

1. Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r app/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/app.py
   ```
